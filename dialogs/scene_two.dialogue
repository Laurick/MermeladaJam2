~ Intro
Jimmy: Wow! You found us in a blink!
Joe: Yeah, Jimmy! This traveler is incredible!
Timmy: Rules are rules, here you have your coin.
Joe: But is not made of chocolate, don't try to eat it!
Jim: Speaking of, who are you and how did you get here?
- My name is...
	=> presentation
- I don't want to talk with you.
	=> no_talk
=> END

~ presentation
Now you think about it, you don't remember your name. You'd swear that you know who you are, but you are unable to utter no information about your past. 
Traveler: Let's say I'm a traver and I'm just passing by.
Timmy: Of course, like everybody.
Jimmy: Like everybody.
Joe: Of course.
Traveler: And who you are?
Joe: We are Jimmy, Timmy, Jim and Joe.
Timmy: We are brothers!
Jimmy: Don't you dare to trick us! Our coins are ours!
Jim: She already won one, so shut up
Traveler: What? Why is this coin so special?
Jim: We don't know yet, but Desafecto seems interested in them.
Joe: Everybody has one!
Timmy: Even you. Well, you have two now.
Jim: Hey, traveler, thanks for playing with us. We seem invisible here and it's been so long since the last time someone look at us.
Timmy: Desafecto is still looking for us for sure!
Kids: See you, traveler! We wish you arrive to your destiny!
=> kids_gone
=> END

~ no_talk
Joe: Oh, another one that ignore us.
Jimmy: But she seemed like she was differente!
Timmy: She vibrates like a newcomer, she's not on the same tune that everything else.
Jim: So let her tune alone, we need to hide to win our game.
=> kids_gone
=> END

~ kids_gone
The kids dissapear in front of you, like if they will never been there.
You are left alone with your own thoughts, feeling the absence of those that were here just a second ago.
How long they have been here? Their names seems familiar
Four kids, brothers, those names...
Traveler: Of course! Was that accident, right? It was horrible...
Traveler: The whole family, yeah, the parents and the four kids...
It was a very notorious case. It was present in all the news in the television.
Traveler: What is this place? What's going on?
Desafecto: Don't you know yet, darling?
Desafecto: You are in the same tune that those kids. By the way, don't worry to tell me where they are.
Desafecto: They have their own game.
Traveler: Are you holding them aginst their will?
Desafecto: Who? ME? No one is here against their will
Desafecto: This is a auspice for wandering souls
Traveler: Yeah, sure. Was that contract part of your good intentions?
Desafecto: A mere formality, I told you.
Traveler: You... Are a monster.
Desafecto: [#mood=smirk] I am not, but I can make you wish that I'd be JUST a monster.
The doors and windowns shut. Darkness starts to hovering you.
=> dark
=> END

~ dark 
A beep bring back you. You head is spinning and you can't even think.
Your mouth tastes like blood and you noticed something thick on your lungs.
You are not okay.
Traveler: Where...? What...?
Looks like Desafecto has beated you.
Traveler: Â¡OW! it hurts.
But now you are alone. Everything indicates that Desafecto left, and you can't notice the kids's presence
What will you do?
- Open the door, turn on the car and leave.
	 => take_car
- Look for a weapon to defend yourself from Desafecto.
	 => take_weapon
- Try to hide as the kids do and pray that Desafecto doesn't find you.
	 => hide
=> END
~ take_car
You don't waste time to start your plan.
Indeed, the door is closed and it won't open.
What will be your next move?
- Look for a key  or something that would open the doors.
	=> search_key
- Giving up. It has no sense to think you can escape. You are traped.
	=> give_up
=> END

~ search_key
You search and search, but don't find anything helpful.
After few minutes you heard a clearing of a voice that you recognize perfectly.
Desafecto: If you are going to poke around my stuff, I advance you that those door don't work with a key.
Desafecto: They only obey me, like everything else.
Traveler: Are you going to kill me?
Desafecto: No, traveler. I propose you something you'll be interested into.
Desafecto smirks, cold an evil.
=> desafecto_bet
=> END

~ give_up
Desafecto: Well, I didn't expect that.
Traveler: ... What?
Desafecto: That you gave up that easy.
Traveler: It doesn't matter. Give me an end. I give up.
Desafecto: Come on, don't lose yoru hope. You still have a chance.
Desafecto extends you their hand and dry your tears with their pale fingers.
Their expresion, although benevolent, hides a cold stare that emits some kind of dissaproval.
=> desafecto_bet
=> END

~ take_weapon
You find what you'd say is a weapon, an ice pick close to a wicked cocktail shaker
You hide behind the door, waiting to Desafecto to turn her back on you.
=> waiting_desafecto
=> END

~ waiting_desafecto
Desafecto enters the room, in absolute silence.
- Attack Desafecto from behind.
	=> attack_desafecto
- Don't attack. You are not a murderer.
	=> not_attack_desafecto
=> END

~ attack_desafecto
You jump over Desafecto and stab them on the side.
Their body doesn't react. They even don't staggers with your weight and hit.
Desafecto: [#mood=angry] So you want to fight? That's good.
Desafecto: But I warn you that exercise makes me hungry.
Desafecto is faster thatn you, and soon you are surpased by their moves.
They keeps you conscious, making you feel every bite in an agony that seems to not have end.
=> game_over
=> END

~ game_over
=> END

~ not_attack_desafecto
Desafecto: Are you going to stay there still? Is that why I acted like I didn't see you?
Desafecto: If you are going to behave like a monster, make sure you can.
Desafecto: You are not worth me has food, neither as toy. Dissapear.
In that moment, you heard your whole body cracking and the pain wraps you up, deafening your own screams.
=> game_over
=> END

~ hide
You found a specially dark place where hide yourself. It seems that even the light doesn't want to get close.
You crouch and observe the whole room. Of course you are on a place that allows you to observe everything.
A perfect hideout for a predator.
...
You are not alone.
Desafecto: Bravo, you found one of my favourite place here.
Your screams leave that dark place, but luckily it doesn't take long for them to be silenced.
=> game_over
=> END

~ desafecto_bet
You are sitting on a table.
The tiredness is more and more noticeable.
Desafecto is sat in front of you.
Desafecto: [#mood=smirk] Fine, I'm going to propose you a little and innocent game.
Desafecto: [#mood=smirk] Is evident that you want to leave here, right?
Desafecto: [#mood=smirk] Don't bother yourself answering. Your voice is annoying.
Words don't come out of your mouth no matter how hard you try.
Desafecto: [#mood=smirk] That's better.
Desafecto: [#mood=smirk] As I was telling you, is just an innocent dice game.
Desafecto: [#mood=smirk] If you win, you are free. If you lose, you'll stay here.
Desafecto: [#mood=smirk] Do you accept?
Traveler: ...
Desafecto: [#mood=smirk] Oh, sorry, you can talk if you are going to agree.
Traveler: ...
Traveler: I agree, monster.
Desafecto: [#mood=smirk] Fine! And in honor of my benevolence, I'll ignore that insult uttered in my presence.
Desafecto: [#mood=smirk] And now you agreed, I'll explain you the rules.
